# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## My Task - To make codebase accessible


This task was an on-the-job ticket, which meant I began with starter code that needed to be modified. This task involved a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 

I used the existing code and refactored it to meet accessibility standards. 

Following the **Scout Rule**, I tried to leave the code a little cleaner than when I found it, for example I consolidated several css elements into one.

I made sure that all links were functioning correctly, and I also created an achor tag link to the horiseon logo in order to navigate to the home page. I reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors, and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
