## My Task - To make codebase accessible


This task was an on-the-job ticket, which meant I began with starter code that needed to be modified. This task involved an important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 

I used the existing code and refactored it to meet accessibility standards. 

Following the **Scout Rule**, I tried to leave the code a little cleaner than when I found it, for example I consolidated several css elements into one.

## Steps I took 
I added alt tags to all images with a written description of the immage.

I made sure that all links were functioning correctly.

I also created an achor tag link to the horiseon logo in order to navigate to the home page.

I reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors.

I replaced div classes with semantics in HTML elements.

I including comments before each change in HTML and CSS.

I created the page title 'Horiseon'.

I Ensured that the flow of HTML and CSS are in sequential order. 

Below is the user story I worked from:

### User Story

```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
